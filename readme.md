# Cloud  Academy - Python Engineer

This readme summarizes my learnings from Cloud Academy Python Engineer expert track . An effort to relearn concepts and upskill myself to be an effecient python engineer


## Introduction to Python Objects

### Intro to Objects
 - Objects are building blocks for modelling real world or abstract concepts
 - Python objects are a collection of attributes . The attributes maybe data or methods
 - Objects are foundational to python because everything in python in an object
 -  we models objects by defining meaningful attributes and 

 ### Exploring Objects
 
 - Objects are a data modelling strategy that defines data using attributes and behavior's using methods
 - If we are modelling a cat the object type is cat , if modelling a list the object type is list
 - Python has already modelling many objects types for us
 - Attributes describe some aspect of the concept being modelled
 - Python provides many different built in object types like string , integer, float .
 
  ### How Objects Get Things Done
  

 - Methods can accept input
 - Methods can return output
 - Methods can interact with attributes
 - Methods are mechanisms for modelling behaviours fro a concept
 - Methods are great mechanism for controlling the state of the object and interacting with the attributes
 - methods enables us to effectively model concepts
 - Calling a method is how me run the method

### Modelling a Concept -> Code

 - Objects are Python's core building blocks
 - In python , class definitions are used to create new object types
 - Class definitions allow us to specify the code to run when the object is created in the constructore method
